excerpt: "If you like the free content I provide on Made Mistakes, here are some great ways to show your support and motivate me to create more of it."

The tutorials, Jekyll themes, and other articles I publish have been a true labor of love for me. If you've found any of this free content useful here's how to show your thanks and motivate me to create more of it.

## Send a Donation

I include banner ads on the site to help offset the costs associated with keeping it live, but we all know no one clicks on that crap. If you'd like to send a donation my way so I can continue to provide free content and themes, hit one of the buttons below. I accept PayPal, Square Cash, and Bitcoins.

## Buy Something

If you shop on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=mademist-20&linkId=P557QDXPWEYIZTDS), using my referral link below will earn me a small commission if you end up buying something. I also maintain an Amazon Wish List if you are feeling extra generous. :wink:

## Follow Me on Social Media

I post fairly infrequently on social media --- I'm not the type to barf out a stream of rants and retweets in quick succession. Posts are along the lines of in-process artwork, speed painting videos, web design and development tidbits, sarcastic remarks, and photographic fragments from what little life I live.
